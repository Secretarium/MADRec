Presentation of MADRec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Massive Autonomous Distributed Reconciliation, or Madrec, is the newest initiative to bring data into line from Europe's and Switzerland's biggest banks ahead of MiFID II.
The cooperation on a joint initiative to improve the quality of counter-party reference data with industry counterparts. This data, when dealing about client details, is often 
hard to harvest, costly to verify, and can't be disclosed. Data quality benchmarks is the capacity of comparing confdential data with competitors, without disclosing data, in order to 
measure the percentage of participants in and out of consensus. The measurement provides a good indicator of the data quality and reduces the scope of data to verify.
